          Core values are the fundamental beliefs of a person or organization.
          The core values are the guiding principles that dictate behavior and
          action. Core values can help people to know what is right from wrong,
          they can help companies to determine if they are on the right path and
          fulfilling their business goals; and they create an unwavering and
          unchanging guide. There are many different types of core values and
          many different examples of core values depending upon the context.
